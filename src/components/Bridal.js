                  Christalee was an absolute life saver. A month before my wedding my original hair and makeup company fell through. I was thankfully introduced to Christalee and she saved the day. The experience with her and her team couldn't have been better. Her communication was above and beyond and she genuinely made an extremely stressful situation such a breeze. She ensured I had a trial and was happy to change things up when I decided my original vision wasn't what I wanted. She was incredible to work with and made me feel beautiful on my wedding day. She and her team were so professional and made sure to take care of me and my wedding party. We were all so happy with their work and would absolutely recommend. The service was truly above expectations and I wish I would have found her sooner!

She was affordable and extremely knowledgeable of the best way to achieve the classic look I was going for. Not only did she deliver with both hair and makeup, but she still gave my other wedding party members a great look that followed my desired aesthetic with their own personal style. All of us looked amazing till the very end of our wonderful day. I cannot recommend her more.
